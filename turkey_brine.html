<h3>Get a head start on your Thanksgiving dinner by beginning your turkey brining the day before. 
    Blair's brine recipe includes classic ingredients like poultry seasoning, a hefty dose of black pepper, and a generous amount of kosher salt.
     But it also includes a secret ingredient: cranberry juice. 
    The combination of salty, sweet, and tangy makes for a delicious bird and roasting drippings that create an amazing gravy.</h3>
