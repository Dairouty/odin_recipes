<h1> Clover Leaf Rolls</h1>
<img src=clover_leaf.jpeg>
<h3>Making these uniquely shaped rolls are almost as much fun as eating them.  
    Brownie shared their grandmother's cherished recipe, which is yeast-based for a fluffy and light baked good.
     To make rolling the dough easier, add a dash of vegetable oil to your hands before you start.</h3>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
         <li>¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
         <li>1 cup milk</li>
         <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
         <li>¼ cup vegetable shortening</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>1 egg </li>
         <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Heat the milk in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbles begin to form, but the milk is not simmering. 
             Stir in the sugar, shortening, and salt; set aside until cooled to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).
              Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Beat the egg in a mixing bowl, then stir in the yeast and milk. 
                  Stir in half of the flour until no lumps remain, then stir in the remaining flour a little at a time until a smooth dough forms. 
                  Place into a greased bowl, turn once to grease the top, cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.</li>
                  <li>Grease a 12 sectioned muffin tin. Deflate the dough, and place onto a well-floured work surface.
                       Divide the dough into 36 pieces, and form into balls.
                       Place 3 balls into each muffin cup. Cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
                       <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
     </ol>
